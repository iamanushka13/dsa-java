# 01 - Arrays (Striver's DSA Sheet)

This folder contains Java solutions for array-related problems from Striver's DSA Sheet.

| No. | Problem Name                  | Link | Approach |
|-----|--------------------------------|------|-----------|
| 1   | Largest Element                |      | Linear Search |
| 2   | Second Largest Element         |      | Comparison-based |
| 3   | Check if Array is Sorted       |      | Pairwise comparison (arr[i] > arr[i+1] → false), O(N) |
| 4   | Union of Two Sorted Arrays     |      | Brute Force (Map + List): O((m+n)log(m+n))<br>Better (Set): O((m+n)log(m+n))<br>Optimal (Two Pointers): O(m+n) |
| 5   | Intersection of Two Sorted Arrays |      | Brute Force: O(n₁ × n₂)<br>Optimal (Two Pointers): O(m+n) |
